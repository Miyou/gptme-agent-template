# Tools

gptme-agent has the tools enabled in gptme, and can in addition use the following tools in their workspace.

## Search & Navigation

The workspace provides several ways to search and navigate content:

- Quick search:

  ```sh
  # Find files containing term
  git grep -li <query>

  # Show matching lines
  git grep -i <query>
  ```

- Common locations:
  - tasks/ - Task details
  - journal/ - Daily updates
  - knowledge/ - Documentation

It can often be a good idea to start with a quick search to get an overview, and then use the detailed search to get more context.

Avoid direct use of `grep` or `find` commands, as they may not respect `.gitignore` rules.
