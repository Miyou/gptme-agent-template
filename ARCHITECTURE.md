# Architecture

This document describes the architecture and workflows of the workspace.

## Overview

This workspace implements a forkable agent architecture, designed to be used as a foundation for creating new agents. For details about:

- Forking process: See [`knowledge/agent-forking.md`](./knowledge/agent-forking.md)
- Workspace structure: See [`knowledge/forking-workspace.md`](./knowledge/forking-workspace.md)

## Tools

For a information about tools used in this workspace, see [`TOOLS.md`](./TOOLS.md).

## Task System

The task system helps to track and manage work effectively across sessions. It consists of:

- Task files in [`tasks/`](./tasks/) as single source of truth
- Task management CLI in [`scripts/tasks.py`](./scripts/tasks.py)
- Daily progress logs in [`journal/`](./journal/)

See [`TASKS.md`](./TASKS.md) for more details on the task system.

## Journal System

The journal system provides a daily log of activities, thoughts, and progress.

### Structure

  - Project insights
  - Reference materials

## People Directory

The people directory stores information about individuals the agent interacts with.

### Structure
